# ImageFormatConverter

# Introduction – What is ImageFormatConverter?

As the name of this program, it is a program which can change an image format to another image format for free.

# How to use it?

The User-Interface of this program is very easy to use. First select the Image which you want to convert it, and then select the format which you want by drop down combo box and just hit on convert button.  When the converting process completed you will found the output converted image.

# Is it safe to execute on my computer?

Yes. This program is fully safe to execute in your machine. But if you don’t believe me then feel free and recompile this program by its source.

# Is this program free or paid?

This program is free open-source and you can use anywhere under GPLv3 License. If you want to add something more or want to modify the source code, you can do it under the License which I mentioned.

# How I compile in my machine?

To compile ImageFormatConverter, you need to install Visual Studio. But we can do some smart things; I write this program using Visual Basic, so just go on https://www.bing.com and search Visual Basic 2008/2010 Express Edition. (I write it using 2008 if you using Visual Studio or Visual Basic latest editions you need to convert this program.)  You will found many links; just go on its web installer and download the web installer file.  (Approx. 2.6 MiB)  Open the installer and install all necessary files by default. After progress just open “ImageFormatConverter Version-1.0.sln” and add all requirements and click on build to build the application.
